# Known issues:
    # - add a check for if a process or driver is enabled
    # - inefficient use of queues
    # - KeyboardInterrupt isn't handled properly across all threads
    # - use of inheritance when composition is better
    # - Processes and drivers should be seperate
    # - despaghettify code
    # - A lot of busy waiting that could probably be replaced with callbacks
